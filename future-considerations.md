# Future Considerations

This document outlines potential future directions for work related to the
**Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework and its operational
instrument, the **Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

These considerations are **explicitly non-binding** and do not constitute
planned changes to the core theory. SBTR v1.0 is conceptually complete.
Future work focuses on application, calibration, and empirical exploration,
not redesign.

## Purpose of This Document

The purpose of this document is to:

- Identify areas where SBTR could be further tested or clarified
- Distinguish between extension and reinterpretation
- Prevent informal scope creep by making boundaries explicit
- Provide guidance for future contributors without reopening foundations

---

## Empirical Expansion

### Additional Human-Scale Case Studies

Future work may include applying SBTR/CMS to additional domains, such as:

- Financial systemic risk governance
- Pandemic preparedness and response
- High-reliability engineering organizations
- Large-scale technological deployment regimes
- Long-lived institutional or religious organizations

These cases may:
- reinforce SBTR’s utility,
- reveal calibration issues,
- or produce ambiguous or failure outcomes.

All outcomes are informative.

---

### Longitudinal Analysis

Some systems may warrant repeated CMS application over time to examine:

- regression pathways,
- changes in coordination integrity,
- shifts in tail-risk calibration,
- or shortening/lengthening of effective planning horizons.

Longitudinal analysis should not assume monotonic progression.

---

## Calibration and Measurement Refinement

### Fingerprint Sensitivity

Future work may explore:

- how sensitive CMS classifications are to evidence quality,
- whether thresholds remain appropriate across domains,
- and how ambiguity clusters across cases.

Thresholds are fixed in v1.0 but may be examined analytically
without retroactive adjustment.

---

### Comparative Scoring

Independent application of CMS to the same case by different analysts
may reveal:

- interpretive variance,
- implicit bias,
- or underspecified evidentiary standards.

Documenting disagreement is encouraged.

---

## Tooling and Visualization

### Diagrams and Visual Aids

Future additions may include:

- formalized diagrams of SBTR space,
- visualization of CMS regimes,
- or interactive representations for educational use.

Visual aids must preserve non-teleological structure
and avoid “ladder” metaphors.

---

### Software Support (Optional)

If software tools are developed, they should:

- assist documentation and comparison,
- not automate classification without justification,
- preserve ambiguity and failure outcomes.

Automated scoring is not a goal of SBTR.

---

## Cross-Framework Comparison

While SBTR remains orthogonal to capability-based scales,
future work may involve **comparative analysis**, such as:

- mapping SBTR classifications alongside Kardashev or Barrow levels,
- testing hypotheses about capability–behavior decoupling,
- examining mismatches between capacity and expression.

Such comparisons must not collapse axes or create composite scores.

---

## Speculative and Hypothetical Use

SBTR may be applied cautiously to speculative or hypothetical systems
for illustrative purposes only.

Such applications must:
- clearly label assumptions,
- avoid claims about existence or prevalence,
- and respect observability limits.

Speculative use does not validate the framework.

---

## Explicit Non-Directions

The following are explicitly out of scope for future work in this repository:

- Redefining core variables (TID, TRW, CI)
- Adding new behavioral fingerprints
- Creating composite maturity or advancement scores
- Introducing moral, normative, or teleological framing
- Using SBTR to argue for specific policies
- Treating SBTR as predictive rather than classificatory

---

## Closing Note

SBTR’s long-term value depends on restraint in its own development.

The framework is intentionally constrained.
Future work should deepen understanding through application,
not expand explanatory reach through redesign.

Ambiguity, failure, and limits are valid outcomes.
