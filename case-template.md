# SBTR / CMS Case Application Template

This document provides a standardized template for applying the
**Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework using the
**Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

All case applications should follow this structure to preserve
comparability, reproducibility, and analytical discipline.

---

## Case Identifier

**System / Institution / Agent:**  
**Time Period Observed:**  
**Observation Window Length:**  
**Primary Domain:** (e.g., governance, security, technology, finance)  

---

## Scope and Evidence Boundaries

**What is being analyzed:**  
(Define the specific behaviors, decisions, or strategic patterns under study.)

**What is explicitly out of scope:**  
(Internal motivations, moral judgments, speculative intent, unobservable actions.)

**Evidence sources:**  
(List publicly observable data, records, behaviors, or outcomes used.)

**Evidence quality:**  
- High / Medium / Low  
(Brief justification.)

---

## Preliminary Constraints

Before scoring, note any hard constraints that may affect observability:

- Resource limitations  
- Legal or physical constraints  
- Information asymmetries  
- Observation bias or missing data  

These do not determine classification but must be documented.

---

## Behavioral Fingerprint Scoring

Each fingerprint must be scored independently.
If evidence is insufficient, mark **0.5 (Ambiguous)**.

### FP-1: Restraint–Cost Correlation

**Observed pattern:**  
**Score (0 / 0.5 / 1):**  
**Justification:**

---

### FP-2: Detection / Emission Asymmetry

**Observed pattern:**  
**Score (0 / 0.5 / 1):**  
**Justification:**

---

### FP-3: Response Conditionality

**Observed pattern:**  
**Score (0 / 0.5 / 1):**  
**Justification:**

---

### FP-4: Internal Coherence Variance

**Observed pattern:**  
**Score (0 / 0.5 / 1):**  
**Justification:**

---

### FP-5: Tail-Risk Targeting Accuracy

**Observed pattern:**  
**Score (0 / 0.5 / 1):**  
**Justification:**

## Variable Inference Summary

Based on fingerprints (no averaging):

- **Temporal Integration Depth (TID):**  
  Low / Medium / High / Indeterminate

- **Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW):**  
  Low / Medium / High / Miscalibrated / Indeterminate

- **Coordination Integrity (CI):**  
  Low / Medium / High / Indeterminate

Explain any indeterminacy explicitly.

---

## CMS Classification Outcome

**Primary classification:**
- ☐ Mature Restraint  
- ☐ Constraint-Based Silence  
- ☐ Coordination Failure  
- ☐ Miscalibrated Tail Risk  
- ☐ Ambiguous / Insufficient Data  

**Decision rule applied:**  
(Reference CMS thresholds or rules used.)

---

## Contradictions and Model Stress

**Were any fingerprints contradictory?**  
- Yes / No  

If yes:
- Describe contradiction
- State whether this constitutes **model failure** for this case

---

## Interpretation (Bounded)

Provide a **strictly descriptive interpretation**:

- What SBTR/CMS indicates about strategic behavior
- What it does *not* indicate
- Any alternative explanations that remain viable

Do NOT infer intent, intelligence, morality, or future behavior.

---

## Limitations

Explicitly list:
- Missing data
- Short observation windows
- Structural blind spots
- Reasons this case may remain unresolved

---

## Final Notes

State clearly whether this case:
- Supports SBTR as useful
- Reveals calibration issues
- Produces ambiguity
- Exposes framework limits

Failure and ambiguity are valid outcomes.
