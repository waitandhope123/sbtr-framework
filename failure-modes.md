# Failure Modes and Regression Regimes in SBTR

This document describes the primary failure modes and regression regimes
recognized within the **Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework
and its operational instrument, the **Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

Failure modes are not edge cases.
They are expected outcomes in real systems and are central to SBTR’s explanatory power.

## Purpose of This Document

This document exists to:

- Prevent misinterpretation of restraint as inevitable or stable
- Explicitly model why risk-aware systems often fail to act coherently
- Provide named regimes for common breakdown patterns
- Ensure CMS classifications do not default to “immaturity” or “irrationality”

Failure and regression are first-class outcomes under SBTR.

## Core Principle

High awareness of long-horizon risk does **not** guarantee:

- effective coordination,
- stable restraint,
- correct calibration,
- or long-term persistence.

Most systems fail not because they lack insight, but because they cannot
execute insight consistently over time.

## Failure Regimes

### F1 — Coordination Collapse

**Definition:**  
The system recognizes long-horizon or tail risks but cannot maintain coherent
collective action against internal incentive conflicts.

**Typical causes:**
- Fragmented governance
- Multipolar competition
- Weak enforcement mechanisms
- Time-inconsistent incentives

**Behavioral signatures:**
- High variance across subsystems
- Public risk acknowledgment with inconsistent action
- Repeated reversals or defections
- Alarm signaling without durable response

**CMS indicators:**
- FP-4 (Internal Coherence Variance) < 0.3
- Other fingerprints may score high but are overridden

**Interpretation note:**  
Coordination collapse is common in human systems and does not imply ignorance.

### F2 — Value Drift

**Definition:**  
Long-horizon institutions degrade over time as successor agents or subsystems
adopt misaligned objectives.

**Typical causes:**
- Leadership turnover
- Institutional capture
- Cultural erosion
- Optimization pressure shifting incentives

**Behavioral signatures:**
- Rhetoric of restraint paired with expansionist behavior
- Gradual shortening of planning horizons
- Divergence between stated and revealed preferences

**CMS indicators:**
- Declining FP-1 and FP-3 over time
- Increasing variance in FP-4
- Apparent reduction in effective TID

**Interpretation note:**  
Value drift can occur even in systems explicitly designed for long-term stability.

---

### F3 — Miscalibrated Tail Risk

**Definition:**  
The system applies restraint selectively, but targets incorrect or low-impact risks
while under-weighting actual irreversible threats.

**Typical causes:**
- Outdated threat models
- Cultural taboos
- Cognitive bias amplification
- Overlearning from rare historical events

**Behavioral signatures:**
- Extreme precaution in low-risk domains
- Neglect or casual treatment of high-consequence risks
- Asymmetric safety investment unrelated to actual harm potential

**CMS indicators:**
- FP-5 (Tail-Risk Targeting Accuracy) < 0.3
- FP-4 remains high (coordination intact)

**Interpretation note:**  
Miscalibration is a failure of modeling, not of coordination.

---

### F4 — Constraint-Based Silence

**Definition:**  
Apparent restraint arises from material, physical, or informational constraints
rather than strategic choice.

**Typical causes:**
- Resource exhaustion
- Technological bottlenecks
- Legal or physical prohibitions
- Environmental limits

**Behavioral signatures:**
- Restraint tightly correlated with cost or feasibility
- Immediate expansion when constraints lift
- No evidence of conditional protocols or selective restraint

**CMS indicators:**
- FP-1 ≈ 0
- FP-2 ≈ 0
- Other fingerprints may be indeterminate

**Interpretation note:**  
Constraint-based silence must not be misclassified as mature restraint.

---

### F5 — Observational Failure

**Definition:**  
Insufficient or biased observation prevents reliable classification.

**Typical causes:**
- Short observation windows
- Sparse or indirect data
- Intentional concealment
- Observer selection bias

**Behavioral signatures:**
- Incomplete fingerprint coverage
- Conflicting or weak evidence
- Overreliance on absence of signals

**CMS indicators:**
- Fewer than 3 fingerprints score clearly
- Contradictory fingerprints without resolution

**Interpretation note:**  
“Insufficient data” is a valid and expected outcome.

## Regression Pathways

SBTR explicitly allows for regression:

- High TID systems can revert to short-termism
- High CI systems can fragment under stress
- High TRW systems can recalibrate incorrectly
- Stable regimes can degrade into failure modes

Regression does not require catastrophe; it may be gradual and internally driven.

---

## Analytical Safeguards

To prevent misuse:

- Failure modes override narrative interpretation
- CMS classifications must report failure explicitly
- No failure mode implies irrationality or moral failure
- Multiple failure modes may coexist

---

## Summary

Under SBTR:

- Failure is common
- Stability is fragile
- Restraint is conditional
- Coordination is difficult
- Calibration is hard
- Ambiguity is expected

These properties are features of the framework, not weaknesses.

---

## Intended Use

This document should be referenced whenever:

- CMS results appear counterintuitive
- High awareness fails to produce restraint
- Long-horizon institutions degrade
- Classification yields ambiguous outcomes

Failure analysis is required, not optional.
