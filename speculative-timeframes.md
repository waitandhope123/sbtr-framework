# Speculative Development Timeframes (Human-Calibrated)

This document provides **speculative timeframes** for the emergence of strategic
regimes described by the **Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework,
using **human historical development as a rough calibration baseline**.

These timeframes are **not predictions**.
They are order-of-magnitude estimates intended to bound plausibility,
not forecast outcomes.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of this document is to answer a limited question:

> On what timescales *could* different SBTR-relevant capacities plausibly emerge,
> given what is known about human social, institutional, and technological history?

This document does **not**:
- assert inevitability,
- claim universality across civilizations,
- predict human futures,
- or imply linear progression.

All timeframes are contingent and reversible.

---

## Methodological Cautions

All estimates below are constrained by the following realities:

- Human history is a single data point
- Development is non-linear and punctuated
- Coordination capacity often lags technical capability
- Regression is common
- Cultural and institutional inertia dominate timescales

Accordingly, all timeframes are given as **broad ranges**, not milestones.

## Calibration Anchors from Human History

To ground speculation, we note approximate historical intervals:

- Symbolic language → large-scale societies: ~50,000 years
- Agriculture → early states: ~5,000 years
- Early states → industrial coordination: ~3,000 years
- Industrialization → nuclear governance: ~150 years
- Nuclear weapons → sustained non-use regimes: ~80 years
- Global climate awareness → partial coordination: ~35 years (ongoing)

These anchors illustrate a key SBTR insight:
**risk awareness emerges faster than coordination integrity**.

## Speculative Emergence Times by Capability

### 1. Temporal Integration Depth (TID)

**Low to Medium TID**  
(multi-year to generational planning)

- Emerges with stable institutions, record-keeping, and inheritance
- Human estimate: ~1,000–5,000 years after agriculture

**High TID**  
(trans-generational or system-persistent planning)

- Requires durable institutions, succession stability, and cultural continuity
- Human estimate: rare and fragile; partial examples at ~2,000+ years
- Stable high TID likely requires continuous renewal, not one-time emergence

---

### 2. Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)

**Low TRW**  
(expected-value dominance)

- Typical of early growth and expansion phases
- Human baseline until ~20th century

**Medium TRW**  
(hedging and partial precaution)

- Emerges after repeated large-scale failures
- Human estimate: ~100–300 years after industrial-scale risk appears

**High TRW**  
(irreversibility-dominant strategy)

- Requires recognition of existential or civilization-scale tail risks
- Human estimate: ~50–150 years after first credible existential technologies
- Often unstable without matching coordination capacity

---

### 3. Coordination Integrity (CI)

**Low CI**  
(fragmented, competitive systems)

- Default condition across most of human history

**Medium CI**  
(temporary, treaty-based coordination)

- Human estimate: emerges within decades after shared risk recognition
- Fragile and context-dependent

**High CI**  
(self-enforcing, long-horizon coordination)

- Human estimate: extremely rare
- Partial examples only; no sustained global high-CI regime yet observed
- Likely timescale: centuries, not decades

SBTR implication:
CI is the slowest and most failure-prone capacity to develop.

---

## Composite Regimes: Order-of-Magnitude Estimates

These are **not stages**, only plausible emergence windows.

### Coordination Failure Regimes
(high awareness, low CI)

- Likely within decades of major tail-risk emergence
- Human example: climate change (~30–50 years)

### Mature Restraint Regimes
(high TID, high TRW, high CI)

- Require alignment of all three capacities
- Human partial example: nuclear non-use (~80 years, limited domain)
- Stable, general regime likely requires centuries of institutional evolution

### Constraint-Based Silence
(restraint due to limits, not choice)

- Can appear immediately
- Does not imply any SBTR maturity

---

## Bimodal (Bi-Cognitive) Operation Timelines

Maintaining both urgency-capable and stability-capable modes appears to require:

- prior experience with catastrophic near-failure,
- institutional memory across generations,
- deliberate compartmentalization.

Human estimate:
- rudimentary forms: ~50–100 years after first existential risk
- stable bi-cognitive operation: unobserved; likely centuries if achievable

---

## Why These Timeframes Are Long

SBTR highlights several structural slowdowns:

- Coordination must be culturally internalized, not imposed
- Risk models must survive leadership turnover
- Incentives must be aligned across subsystems
- Error correction must occur without catastrophe

These processes evolve on **social timescales**, not technological ones.

---

## Implications for Interpretation

These speculative timeframes suggest:

- Long silences or restraint are not anomalous
- Rapid transitions to stable restraint are unlikely
- Most systems will spend long periods in failure regimes
- High capability can coexist with immature coordination for centuries

SBTR thus cautions against interpreting short-term behavior
as representative of long-term trajectory.

---

## Summary

Using human history as a rough calibration:

- Awareness evolves quickly (decades)
- Capability evolves unevenly (centuries)
- Coordination evolves slowly (centuries to millennia)
- Stable high-restraint regimes are rare and fragile

SBTR does not predict when such regimes will appear.
It clarifies why, if they do, they likely take a very long time.

All timelines in this document are speculative,
context-dependent,
and subject to revision through empirical study.
