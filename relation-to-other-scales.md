# Relationship to Other Civilization-Scale Frameworks

This document explains how the **Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)**
framework relates to other commonly referenced civilization-scale models,
specifically the **Kardashev scale** and the **Barrow scale**.

The purpose of this document is clarification, not synthesis.
SBTR is intentionally orthogonal to these frameworks.

## Overview

At a high level:

- **Kardashev** and **Barrow** describe a system’s *capability envelope*
- **SBTR** describes how that capability is *strategically expressed*

They answer different questions.

| Framework | Primary Question |
|---------|------------------|
| Kardashev | How much energy can the system access and use? |
| Barrow | How precisely can the system manipulate physical reality? |
| SBTR | How does the system choose to act once capability exists? |

These questions are independent.

## The Kardashev Scale

### What Kardashev Measures

The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations by **energy throughput**:
the total amount of energy a system can capture, control, and deploy.

It is fundamentally a measure of:
- macro-scale capacity,
- infrastructure reach,
- and energetic potential.

### What Kardashev Does Not Measure

The Kardashev scale does **not** describe:
- strategic restraint,
- risk sensitivity,
- coordination integrity,
- reversibility preference,
- or decision-making horizon.

Implicit assumptions of expansion or utilization are common in interpretations
but are not intrinsic to the scale itself.

## The Barrow Scale

### What Barrow Measures

The Barrow scale classifies civilizations by **precision of control**:
how finely a system can manipulate matter, energy, spacetime, or information.

It captures:
- efficiency,
- miniaturization,
- control at micro or fundamental scales,
- and technological sophistication.

### What Barrow Does Not Measure

The Barrow scale does **not** describe:
- whether such precision is widely deployed,
- whether it is strategically under-expressed,
- how risk or irreversibility constrains use,
- or how coordination affects deployment choices.

---

## Where SBTR Fits

### What SBTR Measures

SBTR classifies systems by **strategic behavior under tail-risk dominance**.

Specifically, it describes how systems express capability when:
- planning horizons are long,
- low-probability irreversible risks dominate outcomes,
- and coordination constraints shape action.

SBTR focuses on:
- restraint vs expression,
- reversibility vs commitment,
- optionality vs optimization,
- and coherence vs fragmentation.

---

### Orthogonality Is Essential

SBTR must remain orthogonal to Kardashev and Barrow for the framework to function.

This orthogonality preserves the central insight:

> Capability does not determine behavior.

Two systems with identical Kardashev and Barrow levels may:
- behave radically differently,
- exhibit different risk tolerances,
- or pursue entirely different strategic regimes.

Conversely, systems with modest capability may exhibit high strategic restraint.

---

## The K–B–C Space

Rather than a unified scale, these frameworks form a **three-axis space**:

- **K (Kardashev):** energy throughput  
- **B (Barrow):** precision and control  
- **C (SBTR/CMS):** strategic expression under tail risk  

This space allows analysis such as:
- high capability with low expression,
- high precision with poor coordination,
- or strong restraint at moderate power levels.

No axis implies progression, hierarchy, or superiority.

---

## Why Synthesis Is Rejected

SBTR explicitly rejects synthesis or composite scoring for several reasons:

- Composite scales reintroduce teleology (“higher is better”)
- They collapse capability and choice into a single metric
- They obscure restraint, silence, and under-expression
- They prevent falsifiable hypotheses about decoupling
- They are less empirically usable

Maintaining separation preserves analytical clarity.

---

## Practical Use Together

In practice, the frameworks can be used **side by side**:

- Kardashev and Barrow contextualize *what is possible*
- SBTR and CMS classify *what is done*

This allows disciplined statements such as:
- “High energy capacity, high precision, low strategic expression”
- “Moderate capability with high tail-risk dominance and restraint”
- “Advanced control with coordination failure”

Such statements are not possible within any single scale.

---

## Summary

- Kardashev and Barrow describe **capability**
- SBTR describes **behavior**
- Capability and behavior are not the same
- SBTR depends on this distinction
- All three frameworks are complementary but non-interchangeable

SBTR does not replace existing scales.
It fills a conceptual gap they do not address.
