# SBTR Conceptual Diagram

This diagram provides a visual overview of the
**Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework and its
operational instrument, the **Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

The purpose of the diagram is orientation, not compression.
It is intended to make the framework legible in under one minute.

---

## Diagram Overview

SBTR is best represented as a **three-axis space** describing how
capability is strategically expressed.

The diagram consists of three layers:

1. Capability envelope (context only)
2. SBTR core variables (behavioral determinants)
3. CMS classification outcomes (observable regimes)

---

## Layer 1: Capability Envelope (Context)

This layer is shown for context only and is **not part of SBTR itself**.

- **Kardashev Scale (K):** energy throughput
- **Barrow Scale (B):** precision and control of physical reality

These axes describe what a system *can do*.

They do **not** determine behavior.

---

## Layer 2: SBTR Core Variables (Behavior Space)

At the center of the diagram is the SBTR space,
defined by three independent variables:

### Temporal Integration Depth (TID)
Vertical axis  
Short-horizon → Long-horizon decision integration

### Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)
Horizontal axis  
Expected-value dominance → Tail-risk dominance

### Coordination Integrity (CI)
Depth / layering axis  
Fragmented → Coherent execution

These three variables determine how capability is expressed.

No axis implies progress, virtue, or inevitability.

---

## Layer 3: CMS Behavioral Regimes

Within the SBTR space, CMS identifies **qualitative regimes**
based on observable fingerprints.

These are shown as regions, not levels.

### Mature Restraint
High TID, high TRW, high CI  
Capability deliberately under-expressed  
Low footprint, high optionality, conditional action

### Coordination Failure
High awareness, low CI  
Inconsistent behavior, fragmentation, reversals

### Constraint-Based Silence
Low TID and/or low TRW  
Restraint tracks cost or feasibility

### Miscalibrated Tail Risk
High CI, incorrect risk targeting  
Restraint applied to wrong domains

### Ambiguous / Unclassified
Insufficient or contradictory evidence

Boundaries between regimes are intentionally fuzzy.

---

## Design Principles

The diagram must visually communicate that:

- Capability ≠ behavior
- High power can coexist with low action
- Failure is common
- Restraint is conditional
- Ambiguity is allowed

No arrows implying inevitability.
No “higher is better” ordering.
No teleological flow.

---

## Intended Use

This diagram is intended for:

- README or overview pages
- Presentations
- Orientation for new readers
- Preventing misinterpretation of SBTR as a ladder or scale

It is not a substitute for CMS application.

---

## Implementation Note

Recommended future formats:
- SVG (primary)
- PNG (secondary)
- Simple monochrome palette

Text labels should match terminology exactly as defined
in `cms.md` and `one-page-summary.md`.
