# Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)

SBTR is a behavior-based analytical framework for classifying how intelligent systems
(civilizations, institutions, or artificial agents) strategically express capability
when long-term planning horizons, tail-risk dominance, and coordination constraints
shape decision-making.

SBTR focuses on **behavior**, not power, intent, values, or moral judgment.  
It is designed to analyze what systems *do* once urgency is no longer the dominant driver.

## Core Idea

When decision-making spans long time horizons and low-probability, high-consequence
risks dominate outcomes, intelligent systems often decouple **capability** from
**visible action**.

Under these conditions:
- Restraint can be strategic rather than imposed
- Silence or low footprint can be a stable equilibrium
- Reversibility and optionality often dominate efficiency
- Growth and expansion are not default objectives

SBTR provides a disciplined way to describe and classify these behaviors
without assuming progress, benevolence, or inevitability.

## What SBTR Is

SBTR is:

- **Behavior-based**  
  Uses external, observable strategic patterns only.  
  Makes no claims about psychology, motives, values, or inner experience.

- **Non-normative**  
  Does not rank systems as better, wiser, or more advanced.

- **Non-anthropocentric**  
  Applicable to human institutions, artificial systems, and hypothetical non-human intelligences.

- **Non-teleological**  
  Does not assume expansion, growth, contact, disclosure, or progress as natural endpoints.

- **Risk-centered**  
  Treats tail risks and irreversibility as first-class strategic constraints.

- **Coordination-aware**  
  Treats the ability to implement long-horizon strategies as a binding limitation, not an assumption.

SBTR explicitly allows for stabilization, plateauing, regression, fragmentation,
miscalibration, and failure.

---

## What SBTR Is Not

SBTR is **not**:

- A power or energy scale
- A moral or philosophical theory
- A predictive model
- A theory of intelligence itself
- A theory of existence, prevalence, or detectability
- A solution to the Fermi paradox

SBTR does not infer intent from silence and does not treat restraint as inherently desirable.

---

## Relation to Other Frameworks

SBTR is explicitly orthogonal to capability-based frameworks, including:

- **Kardashev scale** — energy throughput
- **Barrow scale** — precision and control of physical reality

Those frameworks describe a system’s **capability envelope**.
SBTR describes how that capability is **strategically expressed**.

High capability does not imply high utilization.
In many regimes, increased capability suppresses visible action.

---

## Core Variables

SBTR characterizes systems using three independent variables:

1. **Temporal Integration Depth (TID)**  
   How far into the future decisions are meaningfully integrated relative to system turnover.

2. **Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)**  
   The degree to which low-probability, high-consequence, irreversible risks constrain strategy.

3. **Coordination Integrity (CI)**  
   The robustness with which a system can implement long-horizon, risk-aware strategies
   against internal incentive conflicts over time.

These variables are independent and may vary separately.

---

## Operational Instrument: CMS

SBTR is operationalized through the **Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

CMS is a classification instrument that maps observable behavior to strategic regimes
using a fixed set of discriminating fingerprints.  
It explicitly allows ambiguous outcomes and defined failure modes.

CMS does not assume advancement is inevitable, stable, or desirable.

---

## Observability and Limits

SBTR classifies **observable behavior only**.

It makes no claims about:
- unobservable systems,
- absent evidence,
- or perfectly hidden strategies.

Some successful strategies may be inherently unobservable.
In such cases, SBTR yields no classification rather than speculation.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- Document the SBTR framework
- Provide clear definitions and references
- Apply SBTR to human-scale case studies
- Calibrate and stress-test the CMS instrument
- Explore limits and failure modes transparently

This repository does **not** aim to advocate for specific policies or predict outcomes.

---

## Status

SBTR is a finalized conceptual framework (Version 1.0).

Ongoing work focuses on:
- empirical calibration,
- case application,
- and clarity of presentation.

Conceptual redesign is out of scope.
