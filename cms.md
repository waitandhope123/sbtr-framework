# Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)

The Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS) is the operational classification
instrument within the **Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework.

CMS maps **observable strategic behavior** to qualitative regimes based on how
intelligent systems express capability under long horizons, tail-risk dominance,
and coordination constraints.

CMS is a **classification tool**, not a score of intelligence, power, or value.

---

## Purpose

CMS exists to answer a narrow question:

> Given observable behavior, what strategic regime best describes how a system
> is expressing its capability under tail-risk-dominated conditions?

CMS explicitly does **not** infer:
- intent,
- morality,
- benevolence,
- intelligence level,
- inevitability of outcomes,
- or future behavior.

CMS allows for **ambiguous results** and **model failure**.

---

## Core Variables

CMS classifies systems using three independent variables.

These variables are not directly measured; they are **inferred from behavioral
fingerprints**.

### 1. Temporal Integration Depth (TID)

**Definition:**  
The extent to which decision-making meaningfully integrates future consequences
relative to system turnover or replacement cycles.

**Operational interpretation:**
- Low TID: decisions dominated by short-term payoffs
- Medium TID: multi-cycle or generational planning
- High TID: trans-generational or system-persistent planning

TID does not imply restraint or risk sensitivity by itself.

---

### 2. Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)

**Definition:**  
The degree to which low-probability, high-consequence, irreversible risks constrain
the strategic space.

**Operational interpretation:**
- Low TRW: expected-value or growth-dominant optimization
- Medium TRW: hedging and partial precaution
- High TRW: precautionary, minimax, or irreversibility-averse strategies

TRW is independent of planning horizon.

---

### 3. Coordination Integrity (CI)

**Definition:**  
The robustness with which a system can implement long-horizon, risk-aware strategies
against internal incentive conflicts over time.

**Operational interpretation:**
- Low CI: fragmentation, defection, internal contradiction
- Medium CI: temporary or fragile coordination
- High CI: self-enforcing, stable coordination

CI is a binding constraint. High awareness without CI does not produce restraint.

---

## Behavioral Fingerprints

CMS uses **five fixed behavioral fingerprints**.
Each fingerprint is scored independently based on observable evidence.

### FP-1: Restraint–Cost Correlation

**Question:**  
Does restraint persist even when expansion or action is cheap?

- **Mature restraint:** little or inverse correlation with cost
- **Constraint-based silence:** restraint relaxes when costs drop
- **Coordination failure:** noisy or inconsistent relationship

---

### FP-2: Detection / Emission Asymmetry

**Question:**  
Is the system better at observing than broadcasting or emitting?

- **Mature restraint:** high detection capability, low emissions
- **Constraint-based:** detection and emission scale together
- **Coordination failure:** uneven across subsystems

---

### FP-3: Response Conditionality

**Question:**  
Does the system respond selectively to different stimuli?

- **Mature restraint:** conditional, protocol-driven responses
- **Constraint-based:** uniform non-response
- **Coordination failure:** contradictory responses

---

### FP-4: Internal Coherence Variance

**Question:**  
How consistent is behavior across subsystems and over time?

- **High CI:** low variance, stable commitments
- **Low CI:** reversals, visible conflict, incoherence

FP-4 is the primary probe for **Coordination Integrity (CI)**.

---

### FP-5: Tail-Risk Targeting Accuracy

**Question:**  
Is restraint focused on actual irreversible risks?

- **Calibrated TRW:** restraint aligns with real high-consequence threats
- **Miscalibrated:** restraint targets low-risk domains while ignoring real risks
- **Low TRW:** little selective restraint

---

## Scoring and Classification

Each fingerprint is scored on a **0–1 scale**:

- **0.0** → constraint-dominated pattern
- **0.5** → ambiguous or insufficient evidence
- **1.0** → mature restraint pattern

### Fixed Thresholds

- **< 0.3** → low
- **0.3–0.7** → ambiguous
- **> 0.7** → high

Thresholds are fixed prior to application.
They must not be adjusted post hoc.

---

## Classification Outcomes

CMS yields one of the following outcomes:

### 1. Mature Restraint
- FP-1, FP-2, FP-3, FP-4 all > 0.7
- Indicates high TID, high TRW, high CI

### 2. Constraint-Based Silence
- FP-1 ≈ 0 and FP-2 ≈ 0
- Restraint tracks cost or capability limits

### 3. Coordination Failure
- FP-4 < 0.3 regardless of other scores
- Risk awareness may be present but cannot be executed

### 4. Miscalibrated Tail Risk
- FP-5 < 0.3 with otherwise high coherence
- Restraint applied to incorrect threat models

### 5. Ambiguous / Insufficient Data
- Fewer than 3 fingerprints score clearly
- Conflicting fingerprints
- Observation window too short

Ambiguity is a valid and expected outcome.

---

## Anti-Overfitting Rules

To preserve analytical integrity:

- Contradictory fingerprints are **model failure**, not reinterpretation
- Ambiguity must be reported, not resolved narratively
- CMS does not infer intent from absence of evidence
- CMS does not average scores into a composite index

---

## Non-Claims

CMS classifications do **not** imply:
- intelligence level,
- moral quality,
- benevolence,
- inevitability of outcomes,
- long-term stability,
- or superiority of any regime.

CMS is descriptive only.

---

## Observability Limits

CMS classifies **observable behavior only**.

It cannot distinguish:
- perfect restraint from non-existence,
- successful concealment from absence,
- or long-term strategy from coincidence without sufficient data.

When evidence is insufficient, CMS yields no classification.

---

## Intended Use

CMS is intended for:
- human institutional analysis,
- AI governance and safety contexts,
- historical case comparison,
- disciplined speculative analysis.

It is not intended for prediction or advocacy.
