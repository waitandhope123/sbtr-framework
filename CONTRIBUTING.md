# Contributing to SBTR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the
**Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** framework.

This repository documents a finalized analytical framework.
Contributions are welcome, but **conceptual drift is explicitly out of scope**.

Please read this document carefully before contributing.

---

## Framework Status

SBTR is **conceptually complete (v1.0)**.

The following elements are **locked** and not subject to redesign:

- Core theory definition
- Non-normative, behavior-based scope
- Orthogonality to Kardashev and Barrow scales
- Core variables: TID, TRW, CI
- CMS as the operational instrument
- Five fixed behavioral fingerprints
- Explicit failure modes and ambiguity handling

Contributions must **not** introduce new dimensions, merge scales,
or reinterpret the framework’s purpose.

---

## What Contributions Are Welcome

### ✅ Case Applications

- New case studies using `case-template.md`
- Historical, institutional, or AI governance cases
- Clear evidence boundaries and explicit ambiguity
- Failure cases are as valuable as successful ones

### ✅ Calibration and Stress Testing

- Cases that produce ambiguous results
- Cases that challenge classification thresholds
- Documentation of where CMS fails or remains indeterminate

### ✅ Documentation Improvements

- Clarifications that improve readability
- Diagrams or figures that faithfully represent the framework
- Typos, formatting, or structure improvements

### ✅ Replication

- Independent application of CMS to the same case
- Comparison of scoring outcomes
- Explicit disagreement with justification

---

## What Contributions Are Not Accepted

The following will not be merged:

- New theoretical dimensions
- Composite or synthesized scales
- Moral or normative framing (“better,” “wiser,” “advanced”)
- Claims about prevalence, inevitability, or detectability
- Speculative alien or SETI claims
- Reinterpretation of silence as evidence
- Predictive claims beyond observed behavior

SBTR is a **classification framework**, not a belief system.

---

## Case Contribution Requirements

All new cases must:

1. Use `case-template.md` without modification
2. Score all five behavioral fingerprints
3. Explicitly note evidence quality and limits
4. Allow for ambiguous or failure outcomes
5. Avoid inference of intent, intelligence, or morality
6. State alternative explanations where applicable

Cases that narratively resolve ambiguity will be rejected.

---

## Handling Disagreement

Disagreement is welcome.

If you believe:
- a case is misclassified,
- a fingerprint is misapplied,
- or evidence is misinterpreted,

submit a contribution that:
- applies the same framework,
- documents the disagreement,
- and shows the alternative classification.

Do not resolve disagreement through reinterpretation of SBTR itself.

---

## Philosophy of the Project

SBTR is intentionally constrained.

Its value comes from:
- what it refuses to explain,
- where it yields ambiguity,
- and where it fails cleanly.

Contributions that increase explanatory reach at the cost of discipline
will not be accepted.

---

## Final Note

If you are unsure whether a contribution fits,
ask whether it **applies** SBTR or **changes** SBTR.

Only the former is allowed.

Thank you for helping keep this framework rigorous.
