# Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)
### One-Page Reference

## What SBTR Is

**Strategic Behavior Under Tail Risk (SBTR)** is a behavior-based analytical framework
for classifying how intelligent systems (civilizations, institutions, or artificial agents)
strategically express capability when:

- planning horizons are long,
- low-probability, high-consequence (tail) risks dominate outcomes, and
- coordination constraints meaningfully shape action.

SBTR explains **how systems behave once urgency is no longer the dominant driver**.

---

## What SBTR Is Not

SBTR is **not**:
- a power or energy scale,
- a moral or normative theory,
- a predictive model,
- a theory of intelligence itself,
- a theory of existence or detectability,
- a solution to the Fermi paradox.

SBTR does not infer intent, values, or benevolence from behavior.

## Core Insight

When tail risks and irreversibility dominate decision-making, intelligent systems often
**decouple capability from visible action**.

In such regimes:
- restraint can be strategic rather than imposed,
- silence or low footprint can be stable,
- reversibility and optionality dominate efficiency,
- growth and expansion are not default objectives.

---

## Relation to Other Scales

SBTR is explicitly orthogonal to capability-based frameworks:

- **Kardashev scale** → energy throughput  
- **Barrow scale** → precision and control of physical reality  

Those describe a system’s **capability envelope**.  
SBTR describes how that capability is **strategically expressed**.

High capability does not imply high utilization.

## Core Variables

SBTR characterizes systems using three independent variables:

1. **Temporal Integration Depth (TID)**  
   How far into the future decisions are meaningfully integrated.

2. **Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)**  
   How strongly low-probability, irreversible risks constrain strategy.

3. **Coordination Integrity (CI)**  
   Whether the system can implement long-horizon, risk-aware strategies
   against internal incentive conflicts.

These variables may vary independently.

## Operational Instrument: CMS

SBTR is operationalized through the **Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS)**.

CMS classifies observable behavior using **five fixed behavioral fingerprints**:
- restraint vs cost,
- detection vs emission,
- response conditionality,
- internal coherence,
- tail-risk targeting accuracy.

CMS allows:
- ambiguous outcomes,
- explicit failure modes,
- and model failure when evidence contradicts itself.

## Failure Is Central

SBTR treats failure and regression as expected outcomes.

Recognized failure regimes include:
- coordination collapse,
- value drift,
- miscalibrated risk models,
- constraint-based silence,
- and observational insufficiency.

Stability is fragile; restraint is conditional.

---

## Observability Limits

SBTR classifies **observable behavior only**.

It cannot distinguish:
- perfect restraint from non-existence,
- concealment from absence,
- strategy from coincidence without sufficient data.

When evidence is insufficient, SBTR yields **no classification**.

---

## Purpose

SBTR provides a disciplined language for describing how intelligent systems behave
when power exceeds urgency and risk dominates optimization.

It is intended for:
- human institutional analysis,
- AI governance and safety,
- historical comparison,
- structured speculative analysis.

**Status:** SBTR v1.0 — Conceptually complete.  
Ongoing work focuses on application and calibration, not redesign.
