# SBTR / CMS Case Application
## Global Climate Change Coordination (1988–Present)

---

## Case Identifier

**System / Institution / Agent:**  
Nation-states, international institutions, and global economic actors

**Time Period Observed:**  
1988–present (IPCC formation to current policy regime)

**Observation Window Length:**  
~35 years (~1–2 generational replacement cycles)

**Primary Domain:**  
Global risk governance / environmental tail risk

---

## Scope and Evidence Boundaries

**What is being analyzed:**  
Observable strategic behavior related to climate risk recognition,
mitigation commitments, emissions trajectories, coordination mechanisms,
and enforcement.

**What is explicitly out of scope:**  
- Moral evaluation of climate policy  
- Individual intent or sincerity  
- Counterfactual technological breakthroughs  
- Speculative future coordination outcomes  

**Evidence sources:**  
- IPCC reports  
- International agreements (UNFCCC, Kyoto, Paris)  
- National emissions data  
- Public policy commitments vs outcomes  
- Economic and energy investment patterns  

**Evidence quality:**  
High  
(Long observation window, extensive public data, independent measurement)

---

## Preliminary Constraints

- Global multipolar coordination problem
- Strong short-term economic incentives
- Uneven risk distribution
- Delayed and probabilistic impacts

These constraints shape but do not predetermine classification.

## Behavioral Fingerprint Scoring

### FP-1: Restraint–Cost Correlation

**Observed pattern:**  
Mitigation efforts increase primarily when costs fall
(e.g., renewables cheaper) and stall when costs rise.

**Score:** 0.0

**Justification:**  
Restraint strongly tracks cost and convenience.

---

### FP-2: Detection / Emission Asymmetry

**Observed pattern:**  
Extensive detection, modeling, and monitoring infrastructure exists,
while emissions continue at large scale.

**Score:** 0.5

**Justification:**  
High detection, but no corresponding suppression of emissions.

---

### FP-3: Response Conditionality

**Observed pattern:**  
Responses are largely uniform (pledges, targets) rather than
conditional, protocol-driven actions tied to specific thresholds.

**Score:** 0.3

**Justification:**  
Limited conditionality; commitments lack binding triggers.

---

### FP-4: Internal Coherence Variance

**Observed pattern:**  
High variance across states, sectors, and time.
Frequent reversals, defections, and policy inconsistency.

**Score:** 0.0

**Justification:**  
Persistent coordination breakdown despite shared risk recognition.

---

### FP-5: Tail-Risk Targeting Accuracy

**Observed pattern:**  
Climate risk is acknowledged rhetorically as high-consequence,
but mitigation intensity does not match modeled tail risks.

**Score:** 0.3

**Justification:**  
Partial recognition, weak translation into action.

---

## Variable Inference Summary

- **Temporal Integration Depth (TID):** Medium–High  
  (Long-term modeling and foresight exist)

- **Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW):** Medium  
  (Risk acknowledged but not dominant)

- **Coordination Integrity (CI):** Low  
  (Inability to implement collective action)

---

## CMS Classification Outcome

**Primary classification:**  
☑ **Coordination Failure (F1)**

**Decision rule applied:**  
FP-4 < 0.3 overrides other fingerprints

---

## Contradictions and Model Stress

**Contradictory fingerprints:**  
No

**Model stress notes:**  
High awareness without execution is a core SBTR-predicted failure regime.

---

## Interpretation (Bounded)

Under SBTR/CMS, global climate behavior reflects a system that:
- recognizes long-horizon tail risk,
- possesses extensive detection and modeling capability,
- but lacks sufficient coordination integrity to act coherently.

This case demonstrates that:
risk awareness alone is insufficient to produce restraint.

---

## Limitations

- Climate impacts are gradual rather than instantaneous
- Tail risk unfolds over longer horizons than nuclear risk
- Future coordination improvements remain possible

---

## Final Notes

This case illustrates SBTR’s central warning:
**most systems fail not due to ignorance, but due to coordination collapse.**

It provides a clean contrast with nuclear restraint,
showing that similar risk awareness can lead to radically different outcomes.
