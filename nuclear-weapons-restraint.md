# SBTR / CMS Case Application
## Nuclear Weapons Restraint Regimes (1945–Present)

---

## Case Identifier

**System / Institution / Agent:**  
Nuclear-armed states and associated command-and-control institutions

**Time Period Observed:**  
1945–present (with emphasis on post-1962 period)

**Observation Window Length:**  
~80 years (~3–4 generational replacement cycles)

**Primary Domain:**  
Strategic security / existential risk governance

---

## Scope and Evidence Boundaries

**What is being analyzed:**  
Observable strategic behavior surrounding the development, deployment, signaling,
use, non-use, and governance of nuclear weapons.

**What is explicitly out of scope:**  
- Internal motives of leaders  
- Counterfactual wars  
- Moral evaluation of deterrence  
- Claims about optimal policy  

**Evidence sources:**  
- Historical records of nuclear tests and deployments  
- Treaties and verification regimes (e.g., NPT, START)  
- Declassified doctrine and command structures  
- Observed non-use since 1945  
- Crisis behavior (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis, Able Archer 83)

**Evidence quality:**  
High  
(Extensive documentation, long observation window, multiple independent sources)

---

## Preliminary Constraints

- Extreme destructive capacity (existential tail risk)
- Multipolar strategic environment
- Strong secrecy norms
- Partial observability of adversary intent

These constraints shape but do not determine classification.

## Behavioral Fingerprint Scoring

### FP-1: Restraint–Cost Correlation

**Observed pattern:**  
Despite declining marginal costs and increasing delivery efficiency, nuclear weapons
have not been used in combat since 1945.

Restraint persists even when use would be militarily feasible.

**Score:** 1.0

**Justification:**  
Non-use does not track cost or capability; it persists despite technological advances.

---

### FP-2: Detection / Emission Asymmetry

**Observed pattern:**  
Massive investment in detection, early warning, surveillance, and verification systems
(radar, satellites, inspections), combined with strict control of emissions and use.

**Score:** 1.0

**Justification:**  
Observation capability dramatically exceeds expressive action.

---

### FP-3: Response Conditionality

**Observed pattern:**  
Highly conditional doctrines (second-strike, launch-on-warning thresholds, red lines).
Responses vary by stimulus type, scale, and context.

**Score:** 1.0

**Justification:**  
Behavior is explicitly protocol-driven and conditional.

---

### FP-4: Internal Coherence Variance

**Observed pattern:**  
Coordination varies by state and period. Some regimes show stable command-and-control;
others exhibit near-failure events and internal disagreement.

**Score:** 0.7

**Justification:**  
Generally high coherence, but with documented close calls and variance across actors.

---

### FP-5: Tail-Risk Targeting Accuracy

**Observed pattern:**  
Extraordinary restraint and governance focused specifically on nuclear use,
reflecting its unique irreversible and existential risk profile.

**Score:** 1.0

**Justification:**  
Restraint is sharply targeted at the highest-consequence domain.

---

## Variable Inference Summary

- **Temporal Integration Depth (TID):** High  
  (Multi-generational planning, deterrence stability focus)

- **Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW):** High  
  (Existential risk dominates strategy)

- **Coordination Integrity (CI):** Medium–High  
  (Effective but fragile coordination)

---

## CMS Classification Outcome

**Primary classification:**  
☑ **Mature Restraint**

**Decision rule applied:**  
FP-1, FP-2, FP-3, FP-4 all ≥ 0.7

---

## Contradictions and Model Stress

**Contradictory fingerprints:**  
No

**Model stress notes:**  
- Near-miss events highlight fragility  
- Coordination collapse remains a persistent risk  
- Classification is contingent, not guaranteed over time

---

## Interpretation (Bounded)

Under SBTR/CMS, nuclear weapons restraint exhibits a **high-CMS regime**:
capability is deliberately under-expressed due to extreme tail risk dominance,
long-horizon stability concerns, and partial but sufficient coordination integrity.

This classification does **not** imply:
- moral endorsement of deterrence
- inevitability of continued restraint
- absence of failure risk

---

## Limitations

- Analysis is state-centric; non-state dynamics differ
- Future technological changes may alter classification
- Evidence bias toward surviving regimes

---

## Final Notes

This case supports SBTR’s core claim that:
extreme capability can coexist with persistent restraint without invoking
benevolence, irrationality, or external enforcement.

The case also illustrates how restraint is **conditional and fragile**, not guaranteed.
