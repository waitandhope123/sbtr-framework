STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR UNDER TAIL RISK (SBTR)
Version 1.0

SBTR is a behavior-based analytical theory describing how intelligent systems
(civilizations, institutions, or artificial agents) strategically express
capability under conditions where long planning horizons, low-probability
high-consequence risks, and coordination constraints dominate decision-making.

SBTR explains how intelligence behaves once urgency is no longer the primary driver.

FOUNDATIONAL COMMITMENTS
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR is:

• Non-normative  
  It does not rank systems as better, wiser, or more advanced.

• Behavior-based  
  It relies exclusively on externally observable strategic patterns.
  It makes no claims about psychology, intent, values, or inner experience.

• Non-anthropocentric  
  It applies equally to human systems, artificial agents, and hypothetical
  non-human intelligences.

• Non-teleological  
  It does not assume progress, expansion, growth, contact, or disclosure
  as natural or inevitable outcomes.

• Risk-dominant  
  It treats low-probability, irreversible failures as first-class strategic
  constraints rather than edge cases.

• Coordination-aware  
  It treats the ability to implement collective decisions over time as a
  binding limitation, not an assumption.

SBTR explicitly allows for stabilization, plateauing, regression,
fragmentation, miscalibration, and failure.

RELATION TO CAPABILITY SCALES
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR is explicitly orthogonal to capability-based frameworks, including:

• The Kardashev scale (energy throughput)
• The Barrow scale (precision and control of physical reality)

Those frameworks describe a system’s capability envelope.
SBTR describes how that capability is strategically expressed.

High capability does not imply high utilization.
In many regimes, increased capability suppresses visible action.

CORE VARIABLES
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR characterizes systems using three independent variables:

1. Temporal Integration Depth (TID)  
   The extent to which decisions integrate future consequences relative to
   system turnover or replacement cycles.

2. Tail-Risk Weighting (TRW)  
   The degree to which low-probability, high-consequence, irreversible risks
   constrain the available strategic space.

3. Coordination Integrity (CI)  
   The robustness with which a system can implement long-horizon,
   risk-aware strategies against internal incentive conflicts over time.

These variables are independent and may vary separately.

OPERATIONAL INSTRUMENT
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR is operationalized through the Cognitive / Strategic Maturity Scale (CMS),
a classification instrument that maps observable behavior to regimes using
a fixed set of discriminating fingerprints.

CMS does not assume advancement is inevitable, stable, or desirable.
It allows for ambiguous classifications and explicit failure modes.

––––––––––––––––––––
OBSERVABILITY AND LIMITS
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR classifies observable behavior only.
It makes no claims about unobservable systems or absent evidence.

SBTR does not:
• predict base rates,
• infer existence from silence,
• resolve the Fermi paradox,
• or claim that restraint implies intelligence.

Some successful strategies may be inherently unobservable.
In such cases, SBTR yields no classification rather than speculation.

SCOPE STATEMENT
––––––––––––––––––––

SBTR is a descriptive classification framework.
It is not a causal theory, moral philosophy, or predictive model.

Its purpose is to provide a disciplined language for describing how
intelligent systems behave when power exceeds urgency and risk dominates
optimization.
